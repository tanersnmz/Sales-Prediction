# Sales Prediction 

The restaurant industry is highly competitive, with many options for customers to choose from. To stay ahead, restaurants need to accurately predict their future sales, which can help them make informed decisions about inventory, staff scheduling, and marketing strategies. In this project, we used historical data on daily revenue to predict the future sales of restaurants in Uppsala, Sweden. We tried different feature extraction and pre-processing techniques, including using public holiday and weather data. We experimented with various machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, linear regression, KNN, and gradient boosting to predict future sales for different restaurants.
